# First Markdown Assignment
## Aside from the reasons mentioned in class, why do we need to study and analyze data?

#### Rico
Data science is imperative not only in identifying underlying problems within communities, but they are also predecessors to coming up with viable solutions to them.  This is reflected in the report of the Senate Economic Planning Office (2017) regarding solid waste management in the Philippines.  Through the meticulous analysis of data dealing with amount of waste generated, source of wastes among sectors, and composition of solid waste, the organization was able to identify issues surrounding solid waste management in the country.  As a result, solutions were proposed to manage waste more efficiently, and effect positive change.

For me, data science and analysis has always been part and parcel for a society to grow and move forward. To make sense of facts and figures and use it as a logical foundation is the simplest pattern in innovating in any field. Descriptive Analysis such as what scientists use now to count COVID-19 cases is what helped the policy-makers to adjudicate the quarantine limitations on a specific area. Inferential Analysis by the Philippine Statistics Authority serves as the national basis of data or census of the citizens. Predictive Analysis by the weather experts is what warns the population for incoming threats, and Causal Analysis made by researchers are what innovates our society. Data Science and Analysis is functional in almost every, if not all fields of our community that are beneficial for our comfort and well-being. And studying or using data analysis is helpful, necessary even, to enter any field and become a functional member of society.

Data analysis can help in the industry, where production costs can be minimized and product quality and production can be maximized to give both positive results to the producers and consumers. Oftentimes, when the producers simply want to gain maximum profits but neglect their customers, the data would show that there is a decrease in product quality since producers would tend to cut corners. This in turn over time can lead to a poor company and consumer relationship.

These days, studying and analyzing data is already considered a necessity. With this, we acquire problem solving skills. We tend to think logically and solve our issues and problems in a proper manner in a way that is useful and more efficient. Aside from that, we can see that analytics is everywhere. Whenever we use social media, we can see the analytics and it is important to know what these analytics are all about. Knowing analytics is also useful when starting a business to know the trends and patterns. Today in the 21st century, data and analytics are used and created every single second. Being knowledgeable about these data is useful to know the current trends and interests of the consumers.
